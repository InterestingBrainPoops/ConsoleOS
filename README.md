# ConsoleOS
  
A project that im working on. I hope to finish.  
The end goal is to make a application that you can use to play games that people make and publish on github(or any source control system)  
  
## Time Line:
This is going to go from now to the end of the project.  
 - [x] Get a sample game to test upcoming features. (/TestFiles/Snake)  
 - [x] Make a python script to run the .exe  
 - [ ] Create a basic file system and seperate the projects (Mega refactor 1)  
 - [ ] Time will tell  
  
## Installation instructions  
None so far.  
  
## How to update  
Hopfully the app will auto install updates  
  
## Issues? Features?  
If you have a issue and need a solution, but dont have one, open an issue!  
If you have a solution, then fork and open a PR!  
If you have a feature idea, then open an issue!  
if you have a feature idea and implementation, then open a PR!  
  
### Known problems:
 - [ ] The snake game is in a file called pong.py  
 - [ ] The snake game gets slower the more you play it(That doesnt really matter, but ill try to look for a more optimized one)  
 - [ ] Pygame is not workin that well
